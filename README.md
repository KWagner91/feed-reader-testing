# Feed Reader Testing using Jasmine
Write test suites using Jasmine for a Feed Reader, part of Udacity Course "Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program":
> In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

Udacity provided a pre-existing application for which Jasmine was used to write a number of tests.

# Instructions
